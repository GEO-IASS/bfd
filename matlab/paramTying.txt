# Note
# Parameter tying for ARD based kernels is being carried out in the
# BFD.m function, so it is no longer necessary to keep a reference
# on how to do it 'manually'. BFD.m contains a function that does
# the tying 'automatically'.
#
# This note was added by TPC on 13-Feb-05 and corresponds to
# version 1.10 of this toolbox.
